The study has more components to it, but all I currently need is for these two questions to be answered. ...|||I do but I also understand the reason it's there, because I do much the same. I'd mostly prefer they let them down when they wish or when it suits them, so that I know they're only opening up out of...|||Hahah yea I'd like to do one sometime. It might be a while though I've currently got my hands tied.|||I know the feeling :/ but I also know that time outlasts everything and as hard it is to believe in the moment, things always fade.  I hope he finds someone again, someone better.|||Yes this is very typical. When we invest ourselves in someone it's an all or nothing deal, and we become a part of them. They leave and we have to say goodbye to that part of ourselves and our...|||I don't know what these threads would be without your posts|||I think INTPs and ESFJs can make great friends, but not great romantic partners. I've never learned so much about myself than with my INTP friends. I suppose anyone would look shallow if they weren't...|||Irrelevant but this is exactly my relationship with my dad. It comes from us being so similar but just different enough to clash. The less I need from him the tighter his grip gets and I get...|||Thanks, this helped a lot. I know I do this but somehow being cognizant of it doesn't make it controllable either and I think that irritates me in these situations most, that I can't stop myself from...|||It is because it has to do with my inward acceptance of myself. I spend so much time pointlessly masking myself to accommodate whatever social nature is around me, and in doing so I lost track of any...|||I would avoid someone if they freaked me out (legitimate emotional overload or stalker-ish behavior). I would go as far as to hide in bushes/trashcans if they made me uncomfortable.

Like today I was sitting in a corner of the...|||I think the 'not being good enough' mentality has largely to do with our type, and for me it stems from my enneagram type as well (3 sx). Placing values externally so that we have no sense of inner...|||That reminds me of when I used to play the Thundercats game hhahaah|||Rejection, being told that I am of no worth.  Becoming attached to someone only to end up hurt by it.

He always seems like the softer one, but he's still more level headed internally. An excellent stabilizer for...|||It reminds me of the natural dance Fe/Ti play. When your partner uses it the cycle will probably feel more natural. The two functions always feel like two people slapping each other in the face in...|||maybe, but it makes me so angry when I don't realize something until I'm ten feet deep in it, especially when I was so careful about it. that's probably the reason it happens.   And I'm angry at my...|||Lol if that's insecurity for you then it must be Fe, that or Ti because I always think the exact same thing. I'm constantly at a loss as for why anyone would even like me for no good reason.|||It gathers data from whats in front of it, crams it into overfilled storage space, and then uses all of it to compare what has already been learned to what the user comes face to face with....|||That's true, but a lot of the time I personally just like to absorb what someone has said. I like when they tell me things and I like to listen, but sometimes I'm slow to respond because I just want...|||and happy belated birthday RandomShadowPersonality   right person right?|||Ix92m getting tired of how Si can dig so deep into a delusional fantasy.

Outwardly very different, but inwardly we're painted with the same colors.
